This week, Olivier will present two technologies making Java more dynamic.
One is more about runtime code generation while the other is focuseded on pre-compile code generation for the JVM.

Spoon Vs ByteBuddy: a biaised comparison

Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for creating and modifying Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and without the help of a compiler. Other than the code generation utilities that ship with the Java Class Library, Byte Buddy allows the creation of arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the creation of runtime proxies. Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient API for changing classes either manually, using a Java agent or during a build.

Spoon is an open-source library that enables you to transform and analyze Java source code. Spoon provides a complete and fine-grained Java metamodel where any program element (classes, methods, fields, statements, expressions...) can be accessed both for reading and modification. Spoon takes as input source code and produces transformed source code ready to be compiled.

During this talk, Olivier will try to discuss what we can do with both library and how we can use them for some experimentations.Â  Presentation will be provided with an IDE.

The talk will be held in room <strong>Aurigny</strong> at <strong>1:00pm</strong>
