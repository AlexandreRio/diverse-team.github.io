This week, Quentin will present his work on solver techniques on arrays and finite domains.

<strong>Title</strong> : Efficient and Complete FD-Solving for Extended Array Constraints

<strong>Abstract</strong> : Array constraints are essential for handling data structures in
automated reasoning and software verification. Unfortunately, the use of
a typical finite domains (FD) solver based on local consistency-based
filtering has strong limitations when constraints on indexes are
combined with constraints on array elements and size. This paper
proposes an efficient and complete FD-solving technique for extended
constraints over (possibly unbounded) arrays. We describe a simple but
particularly powerful transformation for building an equisatisfiable
formula that can be efficiently solved using standard FD reasoning over
arrays, even in the unbounded case. Experiments show that the proposed
solver significantly outperforms FD solvers, and successfully competes
with the best SMT-solvers.

The talk will take place in room <strong>Pétri</strong> at <strong>1:00pm</strong>
