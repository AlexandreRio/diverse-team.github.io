Pierre will talk this week about his findings on browser fingerprints thanks to more than 150,000 fingerprints he collected through AmIUnique.org.
His study will be presented at the S&P'16 conference in San Jose (California, USA).

<strong>Abstract</strong> :

Worldwide, the number of people and the time spent browsing the web keeps increasing. Accordingly, the technologies to enrich the user experience are evolving at an amazing pace. Many of these evolutions provide for a more interactive web (e.g., boom of JavaScript libraries, weekly innovations in HTML5), a more available web (e.g., explosion of mobile devices), a more secure web (e.g., Flash is disappearing, NPAPI plugins are being deprecated), and a more private web (e.g., increased legislation against cookies, huge success of extensions such as Ghostery and AdBlock). Nevertheless, modern browser technologies, which provide the beauty and power of the web, also provide a darker side, a rich ecosystem of exploitable data that can be used to build unique browser fingerprints. In this talk, I will exhibit the validity of browser fingerprinting in today's environment thanks to the gathering of more than 115K fingerprints composed of 17 attributes.
