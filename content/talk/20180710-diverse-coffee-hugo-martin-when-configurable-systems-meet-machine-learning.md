abstract = "Modern configurable systems are designed in a powerful and flexible way in orderto meet the needs of more and more users at the expense of their clarity anduser-friendliness. With huge configuration space, it is impossible to fullyexplore strong interactions between parameters that even experts struggle tofind a configuration matching their needs. In order to help users to quicklyfind a configuration corresponding to their expectations, we propose anautomated specialization process based on machine learning. By studying twodifferent approaches and many aspects of the learning while testing the processon many real-world systems, we came to the conclusion that such process offersgood results as well as it opens many ways of improvement."
