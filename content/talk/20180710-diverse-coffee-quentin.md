This week, Quentin will present his work on SMT solvers :

Because constraint programming offers efficient approaches to tackle problems involving complex data types (e.g. floating point numbers or bitvectors), a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the use of constraint solvers in the context of software verification. One major shortcoming, however, is the lack of efficient constraint-based decision procedures for the theory of arrays, as it is necessary to reason about a variety of data structures (e.g. heaps, hashmaps), as well as for modelling memory. Indeed, individual constraints about arrays typically give little information about their variables, making local propagation ineffective. In this talk we present FDCC, a combined solver coupling standard constraint based reasoning and global symbolic deductions, for the theory of fixed size finite domain arrays. We detail the experimental results obtained when attacking SMT-LIB formulas with this solver, outline its main current limitations and propose approaches to overcome them.

The talk will take place in room Oléron (building A, level blue)
