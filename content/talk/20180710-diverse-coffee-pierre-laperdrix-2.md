Our speaker for this week's coffee, Pierre Laperdrix, will be presenting his latest work on browser fingerprinting: "FPRandom: Randomizing core browser objects to break advanced device fingerprinting techniques"

His work aims at mitigating the risk of browser fingerprinting by introducing randomness in the computation of selected browser functions, and thus, breaking the stability of a fingerprint over time.

Kudos to Pierre!
