This week again, one of our PhD student will perform his first DiverSE coffee.

Oscar Luis will talk about <strong>Descartes (a PIT extension for extreme mutation)</strong>

<em>Abstract : </em>
<div>Mutation testing aims to verify the ability of a test suite to find possible bugs in the program under test.</div>
<div>Traditional mutation approaches do not scale well in larger project. A recent paper proposes an alternative  way of mutation that could overcome this issue.</div>
<div>The presentation will describe the implementation of this technique as an extension for PIT,  a state of the art tool for mutation testing.</div>
<div>Preliminary results on real-life projects will be presented as well.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The talk will be held in room <strong>Les Minquiers</strong> at <strong>1:00pm</strong></div>
