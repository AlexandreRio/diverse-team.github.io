"Among the activities of Systems-of-Systems modeling, the software architecture plays a key role by defining the constituent parts and the means they have to cooperate. However, the inner dynamism of this kind of system hampers the whole modeling process and adds uncertainty to the models. To mitigate this problem, possible alternatives including simulation of models to foresee what might happen in a "deploy" environment and model-checking the architectures for predefined properties. To do so, it is fundamental to use design mechanisms that support the uncertainty and dynamism that shall be simulated and verified.In this context, SosADL was defined as an architectural description language that supports a detailed, formal modeling of systems-of-systems. The language is being developed by ArchWare team and encompasses a set of tools from modeling to generation of end-user artifacts. Among the currently under-development tools, there is a GEMOC-based execution environment that will enable the simulation of SosADL models. On the other hand, PLASMA Lab emerges as a powerful statistical model checker, already with some proposals of integration with SosADL.

This talk is about joining the two worlds together: simulation and verification, using the execution environment to support the statistical model checker and to allow the end-user to both observe the execution and verify a set of properties within an architecture."

The presentation is held in Minquiers, Thursday 30th at 1 p.m.
