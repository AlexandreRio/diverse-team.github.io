Hi all,

<span class="lG">Manuel</span> Leduc has kindly accepted our invitation for participation in the <span class="lG">DiverSE</span> <span class="lG">Coffee</span>.
He will be sharing his experience on building interpreters on top of the latest JVM.


Enters <span class="lG">Manuel</span>:
"Developing interpreters is a cornerstone of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) development. Sadly, performances are often an issue when executing large DSL's programs.

The latest virtual machine research done at Oracle labs and implemented in the latest versions of the JVM yield incredible performances boost on interpreted languages implemented on top of the JVM using a mix of Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, speculative optimization, partial evaluation and AST annotations.

My presentation will be a short (~15mns) and (not so) technical summary of the knowledge I have gathered about Oracle labs research and how I am currently applying them in different contexts.

In complement to the traditional Q&A time following the presentation, I would like also brainstorm and use your brainpower to think about how we can apply such advances to the scientific topics of the <span class="lG">DiverSE</span> team."

The presentation is held in room Minquiers at 1 p.m.
