There are two main approaches to add newmutation operators. One of them is to modify the existing code base and theother one is to create a plugin that handles the discovery of potential mutantsand ultimately apply the corresponding transformations.

To answer the many questions that have been raised during the previous DiverSE Coffee about PITest internals, we decided to follow-up with a dedicated session.
Many thanks to Oscar for accepting to clarify these points.


Enters Oscar:
"PITest is a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool for Java projects. It provides off-the-shelf functionalities. It also offers mechanisms to add new features through a plugin system.
There are two main approaches to add new mutation operators. One of them is to modify the existing code base and the other one is to create a plugin that handles the discovery of potential mutants and ultimately apply the corresponding transformations. In this session, we will explore the pros and cons of both solutions."

The presentation is held this Thursday in room Minquiers at 1 p.m.
