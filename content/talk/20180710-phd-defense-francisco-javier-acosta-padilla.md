Francisco is defending his PhD entitled : Self-adaptation for Internet of Things applications

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Abstract</strong></span> :

The Internet of Things (IoT) is getting more and more present in our daily life. As these systems become more pervasive, the need of managing this complex infrastructure comes with several challenges. Plenty of small interconnected devices are now providing more than a service in several aspects of our everyday life, which need to be adapted to new contexts without the interruption of such services.

However, this new computing system differs in some aspects ( type, physical size, etc.) from classical Internet systems which means that classical methods cannot be cannot be employed on this context.

Moreover, the complexity which was before managed by experts on several fields, is now increased by the larger quantity and heterogeneity of the node’s software and hardware. For all these reasons, we need efficient methods to manage the software layer of these systems, taking into account the very limited resources raising new challenges in the way we administrate this software layer.

&nbsp;
<div id="bloop_customfont">These challenges can be divided into:</div>
<div id="bloop_customfont">• intra-node, on which we face the limited memory and CPU of IoT nodes,</div>
<div>• inter-node, on which a new way to distribute the updates is needed</div>
<div></div>
<div>Indeed, the limited computing power and battery life of each node combined with the very distributed nature of these systems greatly add complexity to the distributed software layer management.</div>
Software reconfiguration of nodes (distributing the code of updated or new software features to their final node destination) in the Internet of Things is a major concern for various application fields. It can has a major impact on energy consumption.

&nbsp;

We will present two main contributions. First, a models@runtime engine able to represent  an IoT running application on resource constrained nodes. Second, component decoupling of an IoT system as well as an efficient component distribution algorithm.
