After his interesting talk about bitcoins, this week, Jean-Emile Dartois (JED) will be presenting his latest work on "Investigating Machine Learning Algorithms for
Modeling I/O Interference on SSDs for Container-based Virtualization".

Enters JED:
"One of the most important cloud providers’ challenges is to reduce the number (thus the cost) of used hardware resources by maximizing their utilization. This is done through smartly sharing processor, memory, network, and storage, while fully satisfying SLOs negotiated with customers. For the storage part, while SSDs are increasingly deployed in data centers mainly for their performance and energy efficiency, they come along with several drawbacks. In effect, we measured that I/O interference may induce a 10x performance drop. This can cause a dramatic SLO violation.
In this perspective, we propose to investigate the use of machine learning algorithms for building predictive I/O performance models in a container-based environment. The objective of such models is to anticipate and avoid misplacing containers on SSD storage systems so that to satisfy SLOs. We build up a methodology and investigated 5 popular machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the used learning algorithms produce accurate I/O performance models. Indeed, we are able to predict the throughput with a median NRMSE of about 5%. We report on our experiments and we hope that our results will provide directions for cloud providers to anticipate SLO violations and implement SLO compliant container placement algorithms on SSDs."

The presentation is held in Room Aurigny (D165) at 1 p.m.

See you there!
