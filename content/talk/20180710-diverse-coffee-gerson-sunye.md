As part of our long-standing tradition, the DiverSE Coffee, we are happy to have Gerson Sunyé introduce the NeoEMF tool.  He'll take us on a journey through the ancient history of NeoEMF in order to share the experiences, the success stories, and lessons learned.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
Gerson Sunyé is an assistant professor at the University of Nantes, where he teaches different topics related to Software Engineering.
Since 2015, he leads the AtlanMod research team, which is part of the LS2N research Laboratory.
His research topics are related to Model-Based Engineering, Software Testing, and Distributed Systems.
Gerson has also a long-established academic relationship with DiverSE and currently co-advises Kevin and Mohamed’s thesis.

<strong>Topic:</strong>
The growing use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques in industry has emphasised scalability of existing model persistence solutions as a major issue. Specifically, there is a need to store, query, and transform very large models in an efficient way.
Several persistence solutions based on relational and NoSQL databases have been proposed to achieve scalability. However, existing solutions often rely on a single data store, which suits a specific modelling activity, but may not be optimised for other use cases.
In response to this lack of optimised solutions, the AtlanMod team developed NeoEMF, a multi-database model persistence framework able to store very large models in key-value stores, graph databases, and wide column databases.
In this presentation, I will introduce the development of NeoEMF: many mistakes, some successes, and at the end, a reliable and performant tool.
