<div>This week, an uncommon speaker will take the floor to talk about : <strong>On Turning Domain Knowledge into Tools</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>performed by Jean-Marc Jézéquel, the current head of our lab.</div>
<div>A most certainly very interesting talk on multiple aspects:</div>
<div>for the scientific content first but also the opportunity to follow a talk from a man of experience.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Abstract</em>:</div>
<div>One of the biggest challenges of the digital age is to turn human
knowledge, know-how and procedures into software. When the domain of
expertise is close enough to computer science, software engineers
typically can manage it because they can understand the full spectrum of
the problems, ranging from the problem domain (how to do the right
thing) to the solution space in the computer (how to do the thing right).

However, when the domain stands far away from the software engineer's
expertise, it is much more difficult to do the right thing. A lot of
approaches have been developed over the years to handle this gap. In
this talk we reflect on one of these approaches, based on the idea of
using models to capture domain knowledge at the right level of
abstraction, and software tools to transform these models into technical
solutions. In this paradigm, the mission of software engineers becomes
providing the domain experts with the right tool-supported modeling
languages that is, turning domain knowledge into tools.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The talk will be held in room <strong>Les Minquiers</strong> at 1:00pm</div>
