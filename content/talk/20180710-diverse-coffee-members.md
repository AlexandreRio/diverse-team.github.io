After the week at MODELS'16; all researchers of our team went to Paris to present the team to a panel of reviewers/experts/researchers to assess the qualities of the team and also assess works that DiverSE has produced.

During this coffee, they will rerun the same presentation (with some modifications) as they performed in front of the panel.

What you do not want to miss are the perspectives of work of the team for the next few years to come.

The coffee will be held in room Les Minquiers at 1:00pm
