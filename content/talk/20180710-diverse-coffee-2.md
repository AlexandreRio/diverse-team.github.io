This week we will have two presentations :

First, Kévin will talk about OAuth2 and internet browser interactions. He will firstly present the OAuth protocol and then ask the team a little help to conduct a user study.
We will need to install an extension allowing to collect some information (no privacy leakage). Some carambar will be given to participants.
Another presentation is likely to present in details what is intended by conducting such kind of experiment as well as gathering results (likely after summer breaks).

After that, Pierre Le Gall will present what he did during his internship in the team regarding DSLs and executable source code.Here is the abstract :

This presentation begins with a quick state of the art on the Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) followed by a research report about the domain-specific notions found in General Purpose Languages (GPL). Internal DSLs are widespread nowadays, as a result source documents are closer to the domains. For example, it is common to write SQL (pure SQL, fluent API, …) inside Java code. However, programming languages are executable in terms of machine instructions but are hardly interpretable in the domain way without specific development. Following this observation, we built a prototype design to generically infer domain model from Java source code using annotations. This experience show that, despite the implicit, concepts such as a state machine can be rebuilt from executable source code.

The coffee will be held in room Markov
