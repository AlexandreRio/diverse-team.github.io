The adoption of language-oriented software development relies on the availability of the DSLs needed to express all the aspects of a system under construction. This implies the development of many DSLs which is a challenging task due to the specialized knowledge and skills it requires. To improve cost-benefit when using DSLs, the research community in software languages engineering has proposed mechanisms to increase reuse during the construction of DSLs. The idea is to leverage previous engineering efforts and minimize implementation from scratch. In particular, there are approaches that take ideas from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) during the construction of new DSLs. Indeed, the notion of language product line (a software product line where products are languages) has been recently introduced.

 

In practice, however, reuse is not necessarily achieved by means of monolithic processes where language designers defined language modules and variability models while trying to predict that they will be useful in the construction of feature DSLs. Rather, the exploitation of reuse is often an iterative process where reuse opportunities are discovered during the construction of individual DSLs in the form of replicated functionalities. In this coffee, we will present an approach to build language product lines by means of reverse-engineering processes that permit to automatically extract reusable language modules from legacy DSLs as well as to synthesize variability models to capture commonalities and particularities.
