But PITworks on each module independently, and for projects in which tests use classesof others modules, only a subset of used classes are mutated by PIT.Though insuch cases, mutants that survive the tests placed in the same module could bekilled by test cases of other modules. This issue has been around for a whileand spotted by the PIT's community several times, and it was a main issue forDescartes and STAMP.So this talk presents PitMP, the maven plugin developed torun PiTest on multi-module projects.The presentation is held in Markov room at1 p.m."
