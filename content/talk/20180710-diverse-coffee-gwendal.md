This week, Gwendal will present on going work about <strong>generationg et maintenance of tutorials about DSLs</strong>

The idea is that for a DSL to be used, it needs to be documented. In particular, they can benefit from documentation by example (i.e., tutorials). But producing such documentation is time consuming.

This presentation aims at retrieving feedbacks over the approach.

The talk will be held in room <strong>Les Minquiers</strong> at <strong>1:00pm</strong>
