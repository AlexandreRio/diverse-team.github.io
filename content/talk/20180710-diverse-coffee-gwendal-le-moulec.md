Hi all,

Almost everything about our next DiverSE coffee is VR, except for our speaker, Gwendal Le Moulec, who's 100% real.

Gwendal will be presenting his latest accepted paper entitled AGENT: Automatic Generation of ExperimeNtal proTocol runtime.
In his approach, Gwendal proposes the use of DSLs to automate the generation of VR experiments.
The paper is accepted for publication in the VRST conference, one of the top-level conferences in VR.

Enters Gwendal:

"Due to the nature of Virtual Reality (VR) research, conducting experiments in order to validate the researcher’s hypotheses is a must.
However, the development of such experiments is a tedious and time-consuming task.
In this work, we propose to make this task easier, more intuitive and faster with a method able to describe and generate the most tedious components of VR experiments.
The main objective is to let experiment designers focus on their core tasks: designing, conducting, and reporting experiments.
To that end, we propose the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to ease the description and generation of VR experiments.
An analysis of published VR experiments is used to identify the main properties that characterize VR experiments.
This allowed us to design AGENT (Automatic Generation of ExperimeNtal proTocol runtime), a DSL for specifying and generating experimental protocol runtimes.
We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by using AGENT on two experiments published in the VRST’16 proceedings."

The presentation is held this Thursday in Minquiers room at 1 p.m.

See you there,
