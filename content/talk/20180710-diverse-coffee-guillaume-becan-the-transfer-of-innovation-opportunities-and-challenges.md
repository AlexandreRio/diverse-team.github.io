For our next DiverSE Coffee, and perhaps the last for this season, we're glad to welcome back to the playing field, Guillaume Becan, a team veteran.

Guillaume was doing his Ph.D. under the supervision of Benoit Baudry and Mathieu Acher.
He was working in reverse engineering of variability models with a focus on product comparison matrices that abound on the web (e.g. in Wikipedia).

Enters Guillaume:''
After my Ph.D. at the DiverSE team, I joined the startup Mediego which was created in 2015 by Anne-Marie Kermarrec (senior researcher at Inria - Rennes).
Mediego develops a SaaS solution around recommender systems that enable the personalization of web pages, newsletters, and mobile apps.
In my talk, I will present the underlying algorithms and infrastructure of Mediego. Then, I will focus on the challenges we've faced shipping out a recommender system from the Lab to the "real world".''

The talk is held in Minquiers this Thursday at 1 pm.

Kind regards,
