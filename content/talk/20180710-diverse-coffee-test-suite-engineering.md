Let's give a warm welcome to Benoit Baudry. His name might sound familiar because of the work he has done in software engineering and more concretely in testing. 

He will present the most recent advances about the automatic analysis, transformation and exploitation of test suites. It relies on the observation that software developers manually implement large and strong test suites that can be automatically executed. In this context, a test suite itself is a program. This opens many opportunities to reuse and adapt techniques initially developed to automatically enhance programs in the context of test suite engineering.

Focusing on the case of JUnit test suites developed to test Java programs, we start this presentation examples from large open source test suites. This will allow us to illustrate the various, rich features that can be found in test suites today. Then, we go on with two recent works in which we exploit such test suites for automatic synthesis of program variants and amplification.
