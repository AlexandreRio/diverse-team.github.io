Olivier's talk, this week, will be about diversity in the devices displaying videos and thus the necessity to have a proper workflow in order to transcode videos and stream videos at large scale.

<strong>Abstract </strong> :
<div dir="ltr">
<div>The increasing popularity of videos over Internet, combined with the wide heterogeneity of various kinds of end users' devices, imposes strong requirements on the underlying infrastructure and computing resources to meet the users expectations. In particular, designing an adequate transcoding workflow in the cloud to stream videos at large scale is: (i) costly, and (ii) complex. By inheriting key concepts from the software engineering domain, such as separation of concerns and microservice architecture style, we are giving our experience feedbacks of building both a low cost and efficient transcoding platform over an ad hoc computing cloud built around a rack of Raspberry Pis.</div>
