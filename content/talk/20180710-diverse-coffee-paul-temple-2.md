Machine learning (ML) is being employed in a wide range of application domains; where designing ad-hoc algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible.

In this week's Coffee, Paul Temple will report on his experience about applying ML to SPLs in order to successfully predict the performances of never-before-seen configurations and discover constraints in Variability Models.

Enters Paul:

"Machine Learning is now ubiquitous.
It is being adopted in Software Product Lines to successfully predict the performances of never-before-seen configurations and discover constraints in Variability Models.
Notably, the latter approach is essential to guide the generation of further acceptable configurations and to discover constraints in Variability Models.
In this work, we leverage machine learning in an adversarial way to discover constraints in VMs.
In particular, based on invalid configurations, we create new valid configurations using evasion attacks.
These configurations could be derived to generate products with interesting properties (e.g. feature interactions).
We evaluate our approach by assessing that,(i) using such techniques succeed in producing configurations that are valid regarding constraints of a VM, and (ii) that these newly generated configurations can improve ML classification."

This talk is held in room Minquiers at 1 p.m.
