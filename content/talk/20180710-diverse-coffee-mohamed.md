This week is our last coffee for the year 2015-2016 and it will be hold by Mohamed. He will perform a rehearsal presentation of NOTICE: A Framework for Non-functional TestingÂ of Compilers regarding his accepted paper at QRS 2016 (International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security)
<p class="p1">Here is the abstract :</p>
