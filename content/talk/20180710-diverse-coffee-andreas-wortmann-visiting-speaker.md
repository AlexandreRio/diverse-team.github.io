Efficient software engineering of complex systems requires abstraction, 
domain expertise, reuse, and separation of concerns. Model-driven 
engineering aims to reduce the conceptual gap between domain challenges 
and software engineering solutions and enables to reuse abstract models 
with multiple target platforms. Architecture description languages 
facilitate a separation of concerns between system integration concerns 
and domain concerns encapsulated into components. Integrating DSLs into 
components and transforming integrated models into programming language 
artifacts requires expertise in software language engineering and code 
generator development. Current research in model-driven engineering 
with architecture description languages focuses structure modeling and 
requires component behavior in GPLs or fixed component behavior 
languages.

We combine results from software language engineering, architecture 
modeling, and code generator development into concepts for engineering 
complex software systems as component & connector software architectures 
with exchangeable component behavior DSLs. These concepts are realized 
in a software architecture modeling infrastructure that comprises 
multiple integrated modeling languages to describe software 
architectures, code generators, and applications. It supports post-hoc, 
non-invasive integration of component behavior DSLs, model-to-model 
transformations from platform-independent to platform-specific software 
architectures, and compositional code generation. 

Presented concepts and infrastructure improve software engineering of 
complex systems by increasing abstraction to architecture models with 
exchangeable behavior DSLs. The separation of concerns into component 
models enables contribution of domain experts without enforcing 
software engineering expertise. The concepts support to reuse DSLs, 
related code generators, individual components and complete software 
architectures in different contexts.
