With huge configuration space impossible to fullyexplore and strong interactions between parameters, even experts struggle tofind a configuration matching their needs. In order to help users to quicklyfind a configuration corresponding to their expectations, we propose anautomated specialization process based on machine learning. By studying twodifferent approaches and many aspects of the learning while testing the processon many real-world systems, we came to the conclusion that such process offersgood results as well as opening many ways of improvement."
