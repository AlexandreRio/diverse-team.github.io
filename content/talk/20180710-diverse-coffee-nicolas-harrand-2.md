Hi all,

For our next DiverSE coffee, we are pleased to have Nicolas Harrand as a speaker.
He will be presenting his latest research work on continuous diversification by promoting diversification as a first class property in DevOps.
This work has been submitted to New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) co-located with ICSE.

Enters Nicolas:
"DevOps supports the integration and evolution of ultra-large software systems several times per minute. This pace of software construction relies on toolchains that include state of the art software engineering principles: modular architecture, formal interfaces, explicit dependency models and automation.
A major benefit of DevOps is the ability to distribute and deploy software updates, all around the globe, on a daily basis. However, high degrees of automation and reuse also come with a risk: the growth of software monocultures. We propose to push DevOps one step further, through continuous diversification. Our objective is to build massive quantities of diverse, yet functionally equivalent, implementations of the same system, instead of a single version massively cloned over the world. To reach that goal, we exploit the properties of the DevOps toolchain, and the pool of off-the-shelf artifacts available to automate this diversity of builds. We present the analysis, synthesis and transformation techniques to support diversification at 5 points of a software construction pipeline, which, once combined yield up to billions of variants. We illustrate these multiple diversification opportunities with the construction of a Web application, and discuss the challenges to support diversification as a first class property in DevOps."

The presentation will be held in room Aurigny, Thursday, November 23rd at 1 p.m.

Kind regards,
