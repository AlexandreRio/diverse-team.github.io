This work will bepresented at ACM SAC track on Software Architecture: Theory, Technology, andApplications. Enters Ludovic: Distributed adaptive systems are composed offederated entities offering remote inspection and reconfiguration abilities.This is often realized using a MAPE-K loop, which constantly evaluates theparameters of the system and the environment, and derives corrective actions, ifnecessary. The OpenStack Watcher project uses such a loop to implement resourceoptimization services for multi-tenant clouds. To ensure a timely reaction inthe event of failures, the MAPE-K loop is executed with a high frequency. Amajor drawback of such reactivity is that many actions, e.g., the migration ofcontainers in the cloud, take more time to be effective and their effects to bemeasurable than the MAPE-k loop execution frequency. Unfinished actions, as wellas their expected effects over time, are not taken into consideration in MAPE-Kloop processes, leading upcoming analysis phases potentially take sub-optimalactions. In this paper, we propose an extended context representation for MAPE-Kloop that integrates the history of planned actions as well as their expectedeffects over time into the context representations. This information can then beused during the upcoming analysis and planning phases to compare measured andexpected context metrics. We demonstrate on a cloud elasticity manager casestudy that such temporal action-aware context leads to improved reasoners whilestill be highly scalable.

We are happy to have Ludovic Mouline as a guest speaker for our next DiverSE Coffee.
He will be presenting his latest accepted paper on "Enabling Temporal-Aware Contexts for Adaptative Distributed Systems".
This work will be presented at ACM SAC track on Software Architecture: Theory, Technology, and Applications.

Enters Ludovic:
"Distributed adaptive systems are composed of federated entities offering remote inspection and reconfiguration abilities. This is often realized using a MAPE-K loop, which constantly evaluates the parameters of theÂ system and the environment, and derives corrective actions, if necessary.
The OpenStack Watcher project uses such a loop to implement resource optimization services for multi-tenant clouds. To ensure a timely reaction in the event of failures, the MAPE-K loop is executed with a high frequency.
A major drawback of such reactivity is that many actions, e.g., the migration of containers in the cloud, take more time to be effective and their effects to be measurable than the MAPE-k loop execution frequency.
Unfinished actions, as well as their expected effects over time, are not taken into consideration in MAPE-K loop processes, leading upcoming analysis phases potentially take sub-optimal actions.
In this paper, we propose an extended context representation for MAPE-K loop that integrates the history of planned actions as well as their expected effects over time into the context representations.
This information can then be used during the upcoming analysis and planning phases to compare measured and expected context metrics.
We demonstrate on a cloud elasticity manager case study that such temporal action-aware context leads to improved reasoners while still be highly scalable."

The presentation is held this Thursday in room Minquiers at 1 p.m.
