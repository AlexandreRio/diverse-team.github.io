For this week's presentation, we're happy to have Dorian Leroy presenting the current state of his work on the generalization of model testing for DSLs.

Enters Dorian:

"Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a development paradigm that aims at coping with the complexity of systems by separating concerns through the use of models.
A core characteristic of MDE is the use of model transformations to analyze, create or modify models. Given their prominent role in MDE, it is crucial to provide proper means for testing the correctness of model transformations.
While there is a range of approaches for testing model transformations, there are still many open challenges as they are typically hardly configurable and tightly coupled to a certain transformation language.
In this context, we ground our work in the fact that model transformation languages are a sort of domain-specific languages (DSLs).
This allows us to investigate how to generalize model testing for any DSL and to use model transformations and the languages they conform to as a use case.
In this talk, I will present the current state of our work and the upcoming steps."

The presentation is held in Room Minquiers at 1 p.m.
