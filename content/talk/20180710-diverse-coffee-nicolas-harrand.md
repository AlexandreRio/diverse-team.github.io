In this week's talk, Nicolas Harrand is defying common sense software engineering.

Armed with his strong belief in diversification, he explores source code transformations and their relations with test suites to show how <strong>NOT FRAGILE</strong> software is.

Enters Nicolas:

"There is a common assumption that software is fragile and that a single change will often break it. On the contrary, we believe that software is plastic, meaning that it can take multiple transformations (even changing its semantic) and still fulfill its original purpose.
In this talk, I'll present our work on software diversification in which we explore source code transformations and their relations with test suites."

The presentation is held Thursday, June 15th, in Aurigny room at 1.p.m.

See you there!
