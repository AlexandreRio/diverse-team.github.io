# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The OSS project investigates an extreme version of moving target defense where a slightly different version of the application is deployed each time it is used (e.g., for crypto functions or payment services). We investigate the analysis, synthesis and transformation techniques to support diversification at 5 points of a software construction pipeline, which, once combined yield up to billions of variants. We also evaluate the support of diversification as a first class property in DevOps."
