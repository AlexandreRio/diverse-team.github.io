# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The GLOSE project develops new techniques for heterogeneous modeling and simulation in the context of systems engineering. It aims to provide formal and operational tools and methods to formalize the behavioral semantics of the various modeling languages used at system-level. These semantics will be used to extract behavioral language interfaces supporting the definition of coordination patterns. These patterns, in turn, can systematically be used to drive the coordination of any model conforming to these languages. The project is structured according to the following tasks: concurrent xDSML engineering, coordination of discrete models, and coordination of discrete/continuous models. The project is funded in the context of the network DESIR, and supported by the GEMOC initiative."
