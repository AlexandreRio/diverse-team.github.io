    <div class="article-style">
      
      After his talk, some time ago, about UI code analysis for design smells detection, we are happy to announce the return of Arnaud Blouin to report on his latest advances in this topic. Particularly, Arnaud will introduce one particular UI design smell he has found in previous work: the Blob Listener. Later, he will explain how to automatically refactor Blob Listener instances, then elaborate on the difficulties faced while using statistical tests during the analyses of the results.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      As part of our long-standing tradition, the DiverSE Coffee, we are happy to have Gerson Sunyé introduce the NeoEMF tool. He&rsquo;ll take us on a journey through the ancient history of NeoEMF in order to share the experiences, the success stories, and lessons learned.
&nbsp;
Bio: Gerson Sunyé is an assistant professor at the University of Nantes, where he teaches different topics related to Software Engineering. Since 2015, he leads the AtlanMod research team, which is part of the LS2N research Laboratory.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Do you think that the blockchain can uberise Uber ?
Jean-Emile will talk about the blockchain this week. Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency with or without third-parties. The blockchain features can provide many opportunities in many areas (finance, logistic, energy, insurance, etc&hellip;.) This technology is relying on several paradigms: cryptographic algorithms, a distributed register, a consensus mechanism, automatic code execution (optional).

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Tewfik Ziadi is visiting DiverSE for a few days.
This is the opportunity for the team to learn more about Software Product Lines ! Abstract   Software Product Lines (SPLs) represent one of the most exciting paradigm shift in software development in the two last decades. However, adopting an SPL approach and designing SPL variability is still a major challenge and represents a risk for a company. First, compared to single-system development, SPL variability management implies a methodology that highly impacts the life cycle of the products as well as the processes and roles inside the company.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Ludovic will rehearse his presentation for a paper we got accepted and that he will present in a few weeks.
Title : Weaving Rules into Models@run.time for Embedded Smart Systems
Abstract : Smart systems are characterised by their ability to analyse measured data in live and to react to changes according to expert rules. Therefore, such systems exploit appropriate data models together with actions, triggered by domain-related conditions. The challenge at hand is that smart systems usually need to process thousands of updates to detect which rules need to be triggered, often even on restricted hardware like a Raspberry Pi.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-oscar-luis/">DiverSE coffee : Oscar Luis</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This week again, one of our PhD student will perform his first DiverSE coffee.
Oscar Luis will talk about Descartes (a PIT extension for extreme mutation)
Abstract :  Mutation testing aims to verify the ability of a test suite to find possible bugs in the program under test. Traditional mutation approaches do not scale well in larger project. A recent paper proposes an alternative way of mutation that could overcome this issue.
