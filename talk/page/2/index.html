    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-jean-marc-jezequel/">DiverSE coffee : Jean-Marc Jézéquel</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This week, an uncommon speaker will take the floor to talk about : On Turning Domain Knowledge into Tools  performed by Jean-Marc Jézéquel, the current head of our lab. A most certainly very interesting talk on multiple aspects: for the scientific content first but also the opportunity to follow a talk from a man of experience.  Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of the digital age is to turn human knowledge, know-how and procedures into software.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffeepit-internals-how-to-add-new-mutation-operators-with-oscar-vera-perez/">DiverSE Coffee:Pit internals, how to add new mutation operators, with Oscar Vera Perez</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      To answer the many questions that have been raised during the previous DiverSE Coffee about PITest internals, we decided to follow-up with a dedicated session. Many thanks to Oscar for accepting to clarify these points.
Enters Oscar: &ldquo;PITest is a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool for Java projects. It provides off-the-shelf functionalities. It also offers mechanisms to add new features through a plugin system. There are two main approaches to add new mutation operators.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      We are happy to have Caroline Landry as a guest speaker for our next DiverSE Coffee. She will be presenting PitMP, a tool to run PIT test on multi-module maven projects.  Enters Caroline: &ldquo;  PIT is a state of the art mutation testing system, providing gold standard test coverage for Java and the JVM. But PIT works on each module independently, and for projects in which tests use classes of others modules, only a subset of used classes are mutated by PIT.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-2232/">DiverSE Coffee: Nguepi Armando</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The story &ldquo;Testing Configurable Software&rdquo; continues with a presentation staring Nguepi Armando.
Armando is pursuing his Master&rsquo;s degree in Software Engineering at the University of Namur in Belgium. He is spending his last semester interning in the DiverSE team, under the supervision of Mathieu Archer, for the period of October 1st until January 31st. The topic of his internship orbits around testing configurable software.
Enters Armando: &ldquo;How to test configurable software?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      We are happy to receive Eduardo Silva as a guest speaker for our next DiverSE Coffee.  Eduardo is a Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, with a co-guardianship period in &ldquo;Université de Bretagne Sud&rdquo;, IUT de Vannes. He holds a bachelor degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (2012) and a Masters in Systems and Computation from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (2015).

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-nicolas-harrand-2/">DiverSE Coffee: Nicolas Harrand</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Hi all,
For our next DiverSE coffee, we are pleased to have Nicolas Harrand as a speaker. He will be presenting his latest research work on continuous diversification by promoting diversification as a first class property in DevOps. This work has been submitted to New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) co-located with ICSE.
Enters Nicolas: &ldquo;DevOps supports the integration and evolution of ultra-large software systems several times per minute. This pace of software construction relies on toolchains that include state of the art software engineering principles: modular architecture, formal interfaces, explicit dependency models and automation.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-francois-fouquet/">DiverSE Coffee: François Fouquet</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      We are pleased to have François Fouquet, a Triskell-veteran, as a speaker for our next DiverSE Coffee.  The research interests of François orbits around designing and applying novel software engineering methods to build distributed and large-scale machine learning powered smart systems. Since he defended his thesis entitled &ldquo;Model@Runtime for continuous development of heterogeneous distributed adaptive systems&rdquo;, he has been focusing on the construction of time-aware systems, leveraging innovative solutions to represent temporal data using physics quantum theory to better distributed massive models.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-paul-temple-2/">DiverSE Coffee: Paul Temple</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Machine learning (ML) is being employed in a wide range of application domains; where designing ad-hoc algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible.
In this week&rsquo;s Coffee, Paul Temple will report on his experience about applying ML to SPLs in order to successfully predict the performances of never-before-seen configurations and discover constraints in Variability Models.
Enters Paul:
&ldquo;Machine Learning is now ubiquitous. It is being adopted in Software Product Lines to successfully predict the performances of never-before-seen configurations and discover constraints in Variability Models.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-dorian-leroy/">DiverSE Coffee Dorian LeRoy</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      For this week&rsquo;s presentation, we&rsquo;re happy to have Dorian Leroy presenting the current state of his work on the generalization of model testing for DSLs.
Enters Dorian:
&ldquo;Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a development paradigm that aims at coping with the complexity of systems by separating concerns through the use of models. A core characteristic of MDE is the use of model transformations to analyze, create or modify models. Given their prominent role in MDE, it is crucial to provide proper means for testing the correctness of model transformations.

    <h2><a href="https://diverse-team.github.io/talk/20180710-diverse-coffee-gwendal-le-moulec/">DiverSE Coffee: Gwendal Le Moulec</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Hi all,
Almost everything about our next DiverSE coffee is VR, except for our speaker, Gwendal Le Moulec, who&rsquo;s 100% real.
Gwendal will be presenting his latest accepted paper entitled AGENT: Automatic Generation of ExperimeNtal proTocol runtime. In his approach, Gwendal proposes the use of DSLs to automate the generation of VR experiments. The paper is accepted for publication in the VRST conference, one of the top-level conferences in VR.
